CVE-2023-48795,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

CVE-2023-48795,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

9.96-bit MAC:
both sha1 and sha2 variants of 96 bit macs are considered deprecated. 

10.CBC Ciphers:
All CBC Ciphers are deprecated.

As cryptographic attacks on SHA-1 (RFC 9142) become more feasible, the integrity and security of communications relying on it can be compromised. We agree that reporting diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 as deprecated is on harsher side of the gray area, but it ensures that you are aware of its weakness and the risks they pose. While it can be used as a last resort when no better options are available, this should be seen as an exception rather than a rule, highlighting the importance of transitioning to more secure algorithms whenever possible.
 
So, we recommend that you add an exception to ignore this QID if you want to continue to use this algorithm for some more time.(Avoid using deprecated cryptographic settings. <P>

CVE-2023-48795,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

10.CBC Ciphers:
All CBC Ciphers are deprecated.

As cryptographic attacks on SHA-1 (RFC 9142) become more feasible, the integrity and security of communications relying on it can be compromised. We agree that reporting diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 as deprecated is on harsher side of the gray area, but it ensures that you are aware of its weakness and the risks they pose. While it can be used as a last resort when no better options are available, this should be seen as an exception rather than a rule, highlighting the importance of transitioning to more secure algorithms whenever possible.
 
So, we recommend that you add an exception to ignore this QID if you want to continue to use this algorithm for some more time.(Avoid using deprecated cryptographic settings. <P>

Settings currently considered deprecated:<P>

1.Ciphers using CFB or OFB:<BR>
These are considered uncommon and deprecated due to vulnerabilities when compared to newer cipher chaining modes such as CTR or GCM.<P>
 
2.RC4 cipher (arcfour, arcfour128, arcfour256):<BR>
The RC4 cipher is no longer considered secure and exhibits cryptographic bias.<P>
 
3.Ciphers with a 64-bit block size (DES, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA, CAST):<BR>
These ciphers may be vulnerable to birthday attacks (Sweet32).<P>
 
4.Key exchange algorithms using DH group 1 (diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,gss-group1-sha1-*):<BR>
DH group 1 uses a 1024-bit key size, which is considered too short and vulnerable to Logjam-style attacks.<P>

5.Key exchange algorithm &quot;rsa1024sha1&quot;:<BR>
This algorithm is very uncommon and deprecated due to its short RSA key size.<P>

6.MAC algorithm &quot;umac-32&quot;:<BR>
This algorithm is extremely uncommon and deprecated due to its very short MAC length.<P>

7.Cipher &quot;none&quot;:<BR>
This cipher is available only in SSHv1.<P>

8.MAC algorithm &quot;MD5&quot;:<BR>
All MD5 based mac algorithms are deprecated.<P>
